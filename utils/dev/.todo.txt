finish ('$phong', 1) key structure

fix includes

models/player/custom_player/animset_t.vagrp
models/player/custom_player/animset_ct.vagrp

I had these compile before, maybe missing dependencies? caused by different s1import method?

D:\Games\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\game\bin\win64>resourcecompiler.exe -game hlvr -r -i "D:\Games\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\content\csgo_imported\materials\*"
----
pano - import svg to vsvg, vtf to vtex, etcetraa
----
modeldoc import from old vmdl?? looks like it fixes things, & maybe gives you proper 'content' modifyable assets
----
add vr_static_overlay alongside vr_projected_decals
----
vr_projected_decals is close to generic with glossiness and stuff, also sheets

g_flGlossiness "0.000" is inverse of roughness (=255)
you also got specular toggle

this looks like a s1 imported mat
its used as a default *material* (s2 particle renderers use compiled textures usually)
for render_blob particle renderer (portal2)
D:\Games\steamapps\common\Half-Life Alyx\content\core\materials\dev\roomwalls_white.vmat

inverted roughness
materials/models/props_lab/monitor02.vmat

---
one materials detail is anothers normal (for some reason)
they shouldnt share it as the detail cannot have inverted green
split shared maps after all??
